# Project Overview
This project, I incorperated some of the vue that I have been learning in other classes as well to gain more practice.  The main bit being that I worked on dynamic updates and taking information from one page to another without losing the data so it can be used when the page refreshes and pulls up the new page.

## Main Index
This page is mostly just an introduction to my app.  However, to play around a bit, I added a field that will dynamically change with the input that is given.  Here you can enter your name into the input field and the page will welcome you by name.  I would have had this field transfer to the next page if I had more time.

## Form Page
This page is just a basic input field.  However, I created a store that will keep the inputs to bring over to the next page to use in the business card.

## Business Card
This is the output from the form in the previous page.  This takes what we inputed and stored and creates a nice format for a simple business card.

## Examples
In order to fulfill the mock data requirement, this page is here to spit out some examples of pre-made mock data business cards.  It loops through an array of objects with the information needed for each card in the data portion of the vue for this page.
